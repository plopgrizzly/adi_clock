# Aldaron's Device Interface / Clock (adi_clock 0.3.0)

Aldaron's Device Interface / Clock is a library developed by Plop Grizzly
for interfacing with the CPU's Real-Time-Clock (RTC) and High Precision
Event Timer (HPET). With this, one can time operations, get the time (TODO),
sleep with precision, and animate smoothly.
